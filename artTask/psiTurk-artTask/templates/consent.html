                      You are invited to participate in a brief survey that will be conducted online
                      from the California Institute of Technology in the laboratory of Prof. John Oâ€™Doherty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This study has been evaluated by the California Institute of Technology, Institutional Review Board (IRB) and had been deemed exempted.
                      This survey consists of a series of questions related to your subjective evaluations
                      of artwork. These questions are designed to give us a snapshot of how people make
                      decisions about artwork.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We expect that these questions will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes of your
                      time to complete. To compensate you for the time, we will provide you with a reimbursement
                      of $1. The reimbursement will not depend on your answers; but failure to respond or complete
                      the task may reduce your compensation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The data you provide will be collected through a secure online system called Amazon Mechanical Turk.
                      The collected data will be fully anonymized and confidentiality will be maintained. We may report
                      the data in scientific publications and the data may ultimately be stored in online repositories so
                      that other researchers can utilize this information in future research. However, any such data will
                      be completely anonymized and you will not in any way be identifiable from the data stored online or
                      reported in publications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You are free to terminate your participation
                      and forgo the $1 compensation at any time. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact
                      Dr. Kiyohito Iigaya at kiigaya[at]caltech.edu or Ms. Sandy Tanwisuth at kstanwis[at]caltech.edu.
